    <article>
        <h1>The&nbsp;story</h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s go straight to the point. At the moment of writing these lines, I have been living in Madrid for 5 months. I grew
up in a small village and moved to the closest urban area (Seville) when I started college. I spent nine years there of 
both hard study and work. I had my entire life in Seville: an apartment, a car, all my stuff, my girlfriend, my family, 
(most of) my&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>Of the nine total years spent in Seville, first three years were the process of <strong><em>falling in love with the city</em></strong>, 
middle three were a time of <strong><em>growth, stability and city mastering</em></strong>. Last three were <strong><em>apathy and stagnation</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I am not going to bore you about all details about why I decided to change Seville for Madrid. I decided to focus on the
best for my professional career and (unavoidably) I am making some sacrifices along the&nbsp;way.</p>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This post is heavily opinionated. All is written here are just my personal views. Remember, you do not have to agree
with me, but in case you have a different opinion I invite you to leave your comment and discuss this&nbsp;post.</p>
<h2>Data Science&nbsp;ecosystem</h2>
<h3>Madrid</h3>
<p>In spain, if you want to do real Data Science, you <strong>have to</strong> go Madrid (or Barcelona). There is nothing much to do 
outside these two cities in the Spanish Data Science scene. Over the last 10 years these two cities, but specially
Madrid concentrates a high flux of young and high qualified professionals from other parts of the country running away 
from the financial crisis which was less severe in big cities with strong&nbsp;companies.  </p>
<p>Most companies that demand data science <span class="amp">&amp;</span> advanced analytics services in Spain have headquarters in Madrid, so data 
professionals are in high demand here. So if you want to be surrounded by people talking about Data Pipelines, Machine 
Learning Models and all data buzzwords this is your place. You will learn a lot, I swear. Best projects are in Madrid, 
and also faster career&nbsp;progression.  </p>
<h3>Seville</h3>
<p>The reality is that Data Science ecosystem in Seville is almost nonexistent. Region economy relies mostly on <strong>tourism, 
agriculture, public sector</strong> and some industry struggling to survive and keeping competitiveness despite low salaries 
and terrible working conditions (<a href="http://www.abengoa.com/">Abengoa</a>, <a href="http://www.airbus.com/">Airbus</a>, etc.). Of course there are some exceptions, brave 
companies trying to do cool things, and meetup initiatives like <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Databeers-Sevilla/">Databeers Sevilla</a>.  </p>
<p>My advice to any new graduate who want a career in Data Science is to move outside Seville as soon as he finishes 
his / her studies. You can expect probably pseudo-data-science projects (for example, classical business intelligence 
projects masked as data science, with tons of <span class="caps">SQL</span> and little to zero modeling) and a very slow career and salary 
progression which leads to dissatisfaction and&nbsp;boredom.  </p>
<h2>Salaries and working&nbsp;environment</h2>
<h3>Madrid</h3>
<p>Salaries are higher in Madrid for the same position (I am focusing in qualified jobs but probably It 
can be extended to other kind of jobs). Working environment is also better. This is the direct cause of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">supply and demand law</a>. As data professionals are high in demand wages are pushed up and employee have 
a higher negotiation power. Companies take care of their employees because it is not easy to replace them and there is a 
fierce competition between companies to attract and retain best talent. In the last years Spanish companies are also 
facing competition from foreign firms &#8216;stealing&#8217; their employees offering better salaries and more&nbsp;flexibility.  </p>
<h3>Seville</h3>
<p>Seville is afflicted by a great problem with salaries and many companies have a high degree of provincialism. Time 
as intern in a company before a proper work contract is offered range from x 2 - 4 times the time someone spend as 
intern in Madrid. A young graduate can expect to be 1 - 2 years as intern in Seville while in Madrid is rare someone 
spend more than 6 months as intern. Even after being offered a work contract this will probably be a temporary one, a 
situation that the company will try to extend as much as possible (even ignoring the law with respect to temporary 
contracts&nbsp;limits).  </p>
<p>As unemployment in the city is so high, employees are afraid of losing their jobs and not being able 
to find a new one, so they accept slavery situations like constant overtime. Young professionals without personal 
charges usually quit their jobs after the very first months and move to Madrid, Barcelona or outside Spain, thus 
companies prefer hiring people with strong ties with the city, like a family and a&nbsp;mortgage.</p>
<p>Companies in Seville also tend to be miserly, trying to save every possible Euro in things like equipment 
(laptops, desks) and travelling&nbsp;expenses.  </p>
<p>As I already wrote, this is a (little unfair) generalization and obviously (and thankfully) does not apply to all 
companies in the city, but the tendency is&nbsp;there.</p>
<h2>Prices <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Housing</h2>
<h3>Madrid</h3>
<p>Madrid has a big housing problem. Both buying and renting prices are skyrocketing, middle class is being pushed out of 
the city, and despite higher salaries, sometimes moving here does not always worth it if only money is considered.
Reasons why it is happening&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hedge funds are buying properties in Madrid, pushing prices up and hoping to repeat the kind of lucrative
operations they do in London (a city that is becoming a synonym of expensive&nbsp;housing).</li>
<li>Town Hall blocks new construction projects. The city needs more apartments and there is plenty of room for&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Newcomers: like me, many people is moving to Madrid to work or study. It pushes city housing market under a lot of 
pressure. Basic offer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> supply&nbsp;law.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to prices of other things, like buying groceries or eating in a restaurant Madrid is also more expensive 
in Seville, 15% on average and not taking rent into account. More detailed information about prices comparison between 
Seville and Madrid can be find <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Spain&amp;country2=Spain&amp;city1=Sevilla&amp;city2=Madrid">here</a>. Of course, some kind of products like clothes or electronics cost very 
much the same in every part of the&nbsp;world.</p>
<h3>Seville</h3>
<p>Seville is generally a cheap city for living. Renting an apartment in (or close to) the city centre is relatively 
affordable. Eating until burst for 10 Euros or having a drink for 4 Euros is easy, which translates in doing more 
outdoor life and connecting with the community. Seville is located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baetic_Depression">Guadalquivir valley</a>, the 
second most fertile land in the world after Nile delta, so buying top quality fruit and vegetables is also&nbsp;easy.  </p>
<p>Although housing prices are lower, houses in Seville are generally lower quality than in Madrid, with a bad isolation 
and no central heating, what makes them very cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer, despite winters in 
Seville are milder than in Madrid. All heating and cooling is electricity based, and electricity is becoming 
increasingly&nbsp;expensive.</p>
<h2>Quality of&nbsp;Life</h2>
<h3>Madrid</h3>
<p>I find life in Madrid <strong>faster</strong> and more stressful than in Seville. There is a lot of people and everyone looks like 
in a hurry. That frenetic feeling ends up infiltrating. Madrid is also much bigger than Seville, but the transportation 
system is, in my opinion, one of the best I have ever seen, specially Madrid Metro network. Cultural offer is obviously 
more diverse and better in Madrid, and city is also more international, with people from all over the world and a strong
foreign communities from China, Latin America and many European countries. People and city culture in Madrid is very 
welcoming and the city is also fairly&nbsp;safe.</p>
<h3>Seville</h3>
<p>Quality of life in Seville is very high. Lifestyle is superb and you can really feel very connected with the city life.
Climate is good most of the year (with exception of summer months that can be very hot) and it foster people to hang out
with friends very often. City centre is also very beautiful and charming. People is also very nice. If you love all 
Spanish cliches you see in media, will find almost all of them in&nbsp;Seville.</p>
<p>Transportation system is terrible, with only one underground line and mostly based on urban buses. Buses routes and 
frequency follow some illogical patterns, with buses in routes anybody takes with 5 minutes frequency while the most 
important routes are&nbsp;collapsed.</p>
